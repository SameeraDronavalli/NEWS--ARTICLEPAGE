            <h2>"The HMPV Virus: How it Spreads and How to Protect Yourself"</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Health experts have clarified that HMPV is not a new virus. It was first identified in 2001 and it has been circulating in the entire world since many years. HMPV spreads through air, by way of respiration. This can affect persons of all age groups. The virus spreads more during the winter and the early spring months.<br>Symptoms of the virus include <mark>fever, cough, and shortness of breath,</mark> and can range from mild to severe. The virus is highly contagious and can be spread through human-to-human contact</p>
            <h2>Precautionary Measures</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Preventing the spread of HMPV involves simple hygiene practices, such as frequent hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and covering your mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing. Regular cleaning of frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs and tables, is also recommended. Dr Ravindra M Mehta, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals, advised that face masks should only be used when a disease becomes endemic or pandemic, a situation that has not yet arisen with HMPV.</p>
